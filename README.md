This is my npm business card

Created based on the guide from [@natterstefan](https://medium.com/@natterstefan/how-to-create-your-personal-npm-business-card-816dfc66ca8)

# Usage

## npm
```
npx mokkapps
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @mokkapps/npm-business-card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
